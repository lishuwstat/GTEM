## Application:

The file "Data.csv" includes a simulated data set with the number of groups being 7000 and two covariates.

The main program is in file "Analysis File.txt", which can produce the estimated covariate effects in terms of point estimates, standard errors, and p-values, as well as the estimated survival functions for some subgroups with different covariate combinations. 

Some necessary functions are given in the file "Support functions.txt".

One needs to put the three files in the working directory before running the main program in file "Analysis File.txt".

## Simulations:

The main program is in "Simulation studies.txt" file, which can produce similar simulation results to these in Table 1 and Figure 1 of the main paper and in Table S1 and Figure S1 of the supplementary file. The results may be slightly different due to the use of parallel computing. 

Some necessary functions are given in the file "Support functions sim.txt".

One needs to put these two files in the working directory before running the main program in "Simulation studies.txt" file.
