The codes in the file "Simulation-table1.txt" can reproduce the numerical results with \alpha=\beta=1 given in Table 1 of the main paper exactly.  


The codes in the file "Simulation-tableS1.txt" can reproduce the numerical results with \alpha=\beta=1 given in Table S1 of the supplementary materials exactly.  


With the two files, one can easily make some modifications to the codes to reproduce other results given in the Table 1 and Table S1 exactly.
