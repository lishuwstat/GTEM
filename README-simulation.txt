The codes in the file "Simulation-table1.txt" can reproduce the numerical results with alpha=beta=1 given in Table 1 of the main paper exactly.  


The codes in the file "Simulation-tableS1.txt" can reproduce the numerical results with alpha=beta=1 given in Table S1 of the supplementary materials exactly.  


With the two files, one can change alpha and beta values in line 4 of the code to reproduce other results given in Table 1 and Table S1 exactly.
