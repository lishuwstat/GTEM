In this example, we give the estimates of S(t) with \alpha=\beta=1, five covariates and varying group sizes.
One can easily make some modifications to the code to obtain other results in the paper. 


In particular, please set the working directory first, such as "setwd("D:/wd21")" in our code.

Before running the main code in the file "Simulation-figures-main.txt", one needs to obtain the estimates of S(t)
with the proposed group testing method, the individual method (n) and the individual method (N).
 
In particular, 

the code in the file "Simulation-figures-GT1.txt" produces the estimates of S(t) with the proposed group testing method;

the code in the file "Simulation-figures-Individual (n) (2).txt" produces the estimates of S(t) with the individual method (n);

the code in the file "Simulation-figures-Individual (N) .txt" produces the estimates of S(t) with the individual method (N).
